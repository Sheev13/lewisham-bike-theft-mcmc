### Performing MCMC with Lewisham Bike Theft Data

This repository contains the data, the task brief, my code, and my report for the 4M24 Computational Statistics and Machine Learning course of Part IIB of the Engineering Tripos at the University of Cambridge. The task comes in two parts. In the first part, noisy datasets are generated from 2D Gaussian Process prior samples, and the efficacy of standard Gaussian random walk Metropolis-Hastings and preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Metropolis-Hastings MCMC schemes are compared. The goal here is to perform inference over a grid of function evaluations of the true, underlying GP prior sample when in the presence of just a few noisy observations. In second half of the task, bike theft data from the Lewisham borough in London is used instead of the artificial data, and the goal is to infer the underlying bike theft pattern across Lewisham from the noisy dataset.

There is much in the report and repository that the brief did not require, and this is because I allowed myself to go on many interesting tangents while doing this coursework. My mark for the task was 100%. Not all of the code is my own; a few functions in 'functions.py' were partially implemented already, but most of the code is indeed my own. The most important file to view in this repository is the report.
